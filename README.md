# SCS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/karanveerm/SCS.jl.png)](https://travis-ci.org/karanveerm/SCS.jl)

Julia wrapper around SCS for CVX.jl.

## Current status:
- Wrapper around SCS is mostly ready. Test is passing.
- Need to clean code a bit more and allow easy extraction of primal, dual, slack variables. Need to comment code.
- Need to finish deps/ and make it work on Windows
